# game_progress_db

This repository contains migrations and data initialization scripts for game_progress_db, a PostgreSQL database used to store player progress, levels, achievements, and aggregated gameplay statistics. All schema changes are managed through Flyway migrations, including creation of tables, reference data loading, and seed data insertion. The repository also includes a Docker Compose setup for running the database and applying migrations locally.
